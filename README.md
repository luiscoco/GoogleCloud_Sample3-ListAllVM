# GoogleCloud_Sample3-ListAllVM

This code demonstrates how to use the Google Cloud Compute API to list all virtual machine instances in a Google Cloud project.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code begins by importing the necessary namespaces and packages required to interact with the Google Cloud Compute API.
2. The projectId variable is set to the ID of the Google Cloud project for which you want to list the virtual machine instances.
3. The InstancesClient is created by calling the InstancesClient.CreateAsync() method. This client will be used to send requests to the Compute API. It is created only once and can be reused for multiple requests.
4. An empty IList<Instance> called allInstances is initialized. This list will store all the virtual machine instances retrieved from the API.
5. The client.AggregatedListAsync(projectId) method is called in a foreach loop with the await keyword. This method returns an asynchronous sequence of key-value pairs, where the key is a zone and the value is a collection of instances in that zone. This allows you to retrieve instances zone by zone.
6. Inside the loop, the instancesByZone.Key is printed, which represents the current zone being processed.
7. Another foreach loop is used to iterate over the collection of instances in the current zone (instancesByZone.Value.Instances).
8. For each instance, its Name property is printed, and the instance is added to the allInstances list.
9. The loop continues until all zones and instances have been processed.

Overall, this code retrieves a list of virtual machine instances in a Google Cloud project by using the Compute API and prints their names to the console. The instances are also stored in the allInstances list for further processing if needed.
  
## Code
  
```csharp
using Google.Cloud.Compute.V1;

string projectId = "XXXXXXXXXXX";
// Initialize client that will be used to send requests. This client only needs to be created
// once, and can be reused for multiple requests.
InstancesClient client = await InstancesClient.CreateAsync();
IList<Instance> allInstances = new List<Instance>();

// Make the request to list all VM instances in a project.
await foreach (var instancesByZone in client.AggregatedListAsync(projectId))
{
    // The result contains a KeyValuePair collection, where the key is a zone and the value
    // is a collection of instances in that zone.
    Console.WriteLine($"Instances for zone: {instancesByZone.Key}");
    foreach (var instance in instancesByZone.Value.Instances)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"-- Name: {instance.Name}");
        allInstances.Add(instance);
    }
} 
```
